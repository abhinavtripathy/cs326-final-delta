## HealthPool

### Semester - Fall 2020

### Overview of the Application

Our idea is an app that helps coordinate carpools for people who've just had surgery and therefore cannot drive. This would help people who don't have friends/family in the area or couldn't afford an Uber. There could be entries for different hospitals, and profiles for both volunteer drivers (who must be verified by the hospital in the app) and the people who need rides.

A user can sign up as a Patient or a Driver. If a user signs up as a patient, they naviagte to `Patient Sign Up`, where they enter their details like Name, phone number, email, emergency number, address, password and pick up location. They will get naviagted to their profile page where they can view all their details. If a user signs up as a driver, they navigate to `Driver Sign Up`, where they enter all their user information like Name, phone number, email, and password; they also enter their vehicle information. Once they sign up, they will be navigated to their profile page from where they can view all their inforamtion. 

A driver can navigate to `Active Patients` which will show them all the patients that have signed up for the application. From there, they can select a patient who they want to pick up. Once they click `Select Patient`, they can view all the relevant information of the patient they are picking up, in their `View Profile` page.

Similarly, once a driver selects a patient, the patient can go to their `View Profile` page and see the vehicle and user information of the driver.
