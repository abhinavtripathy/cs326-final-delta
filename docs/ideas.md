### Innovative Idea

Our idea is an app that helps coordinate carpools for people who've just had surgery and therefore cannot drive. This would help people who don't have friends/family in the area or couldn't afford an Uber. There could be entries for different hospitals, and profiles for both volunteer drivers (who must be verified by the hospital in the app) and the people who need rides.
