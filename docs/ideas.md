### Team Name

Delta

### Application Name

HealthPool - The carpooling/rideshare service for patients discharged from a hospital. 

### Team Overview

* Abhinav Tripathy - abhinavtripathy
* Aditya Narayanan - AdiNar1106
* Joseph Black - jbinvnt

### Innovative Idea

Our idea is an app that helps coordinate carpools for people who've just had surgery and therefore cannot drive. This would help people who don't have friends/family in the area or couldn't afford an Uber. There could be entries for different hospitals, and profiles for both volunteer drivers (who must be verified by the hospital in the app) and the people who need rides.

### Important Components

* Form to add hospitals (available to administrators)
* List view of participating hospitals and information including name, address, and number of patients/drivers
* Patient's dashboard view that allows them to input their home address before their procedure and select their doctor
* Doctor's view that allows them to choose a patient and update their procedure end time, add special instructions, and room number
* Volunteer drivers must sign up by adding their name, contact information, and car make/model/license plate. All new driver accounts must be verified by administrators before patients are assigned to them.

### Stretch Goals
* Integrates the Google Maps API
  - Displays routes on the webpage
  - Calculates optimal assignment of patients to drivers to minimize driving distance
* Chain of trust
  - Administrators verify hospital manager accounts, who in turn verify drivers
