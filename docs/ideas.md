### Innovative Idea

Our idea is an app that helps coordinate carpools for people who've just had surgery and therefore cannot drive. This would help people who don't have friends/family in the area or couldn't afford an Uber. There could be entries for different hospitals, and profiles for both volunteer drivers (who must be verified by the hospital in the app) and the people who need rides.

### Important Components

Hospitals are added using a form available to administrators. Users can view information about participating hospitals including name, address, and number of patients/drivers. Patients' profiles allow them to input their room number/exit door and home address before their procedure. Volunteer drivers must sign up by adding their name, contact information, and car make/model/license plate. All new driver accounts must be verified by administrators before patients are assigned to them.

### Stretch Goals
* Integrates the Google Maps API
  - Displays routes on the webpage
  - Calculates optimal assignment of patients to drivers to minimize driving distance
* Chain of trust
  - Administrators verify hospital manager accounts, who in turn verify drivers
